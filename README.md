# MSc Oecon, The Pricing of Climate-Related Risk Perception

Repository containing the code that generated the results for our MSc Thesis in
Economics at Aarhus University. Our thesis aimed to quantify and understand the
financial risks associated with climate change. We built upon existing
literature by using social media attention as a proxy for the intensity of
climate change awareness. Our thesis served as a call for policy action,
emphasizing the need to raise public awareness about the impact of climate
change on various sectors of the financial economy and the importance of
managing and mitigating climate-related equity risks. We achieved a grade of
A (ECTS).
